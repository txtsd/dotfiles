--[[ Support project-specific versions of tools (Formatters, Linters, LSP, …) ]]
--
-- INFO: This is very basic and limited implementation:
-- - Project root directory is detected based on directory where Neovim was started.
-- - That project's tools will be used even if you'll later open file from another project.
